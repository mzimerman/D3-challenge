## Background

### Description
This project uses D3.js to visualize some state-level data about population health based on 2014 U.S. Census data.  It simulates an on-line newspaper article with an interactive visualization.  Three risk factors (obesity, smoking, and uninsurance rates) are plotted against three perhaps underlying factors (income, poverty rate, and age).
